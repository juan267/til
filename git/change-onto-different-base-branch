If you created a branch based on let's say for example `develop`. 
And then added a bunch of commits only to find out that you should had used `master` as your base branch. 
You can easily rebase you branch using the `rebase --onto` command:

```
git rebase --onto new_base_branch old_base_branch current_branch
```

So in the example the command would be

```
git rebase --onto master develop branch-im-working-on
```
